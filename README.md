After 2 months of hardwork, I finished Minishell with my colleague and dear friend Júlio Souza (https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliosouzadev/).
Minishell is a project that revolves on recreating a Unix command interpreter such as the bash.
This project is all about constructing a lexer, an algorithm that interprets, divides and categorizes the user input in words or tokens and then building a data structure that holds that parsed data.
This structure allows the separation of different commands and its arguments and also pipes for the execution of those to be smooth and manageable.
The execution involves the handling of a process pipeline through which the processes communicate with each other, thanks to file descriptor handling.
To give a clearer picture of the technical depth involved in building a project like Minishell, here are some of the core concepts and mechanisms that make it work:
• Pipes & process chaining
• Lexers, tokenizers & abstract syntax trees
• Shell prompt loop (REPL design)
• C
• Makefile
